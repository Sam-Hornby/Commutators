# spin operators
- spin operators:
  - adding new operator type:
    - put in match functions etc # maybe done
    - deal with in commutators # maybe done
    - expose to python
  - holstein primakov transform
  - tests:
    - unit type from python
    - physical examples

# create expression from string
- parsing:
  - error checking
  - tokeniser
  - ast creation
  - expression creation
  - testing

# create basis transform
- create basis transform:
  - create transform
  - add tests

# examples tasks
- physical examples:
  - weakly interacting bose gas
  - more from 4th year

# misc improvements
- improvements:
  - take order id out of Operator struct
  - create equality operatorish thing for expressions
  - sort additionterms in simplify 
  - test hermitian conj better
  - remove O(n^2) with recursive * ops instead of inserting straight into the vector
  - deal with and test ops/comutations with different symbols
  - have a create from string function
  - reuse more between fock1d and 0d:
    - current idea, have the infos, then a coord struct
